=============================
Configure access to openstack
=============================

In order to install and work with the testbed you will need gitlab access to store the OpenTofu state and openstack access to deploy the testbed.
To do this, `download the openstack rc file <https://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/cli-reference/common/cli_set_environment_variables_using_openstack_rc.html#download-and-source-the-openstack-rc-file>`_ and save it as an .env file in the top level of the testbed repository:

::

    cp <path-to-openstackrc> .env

We also need the Gitlab-user and Gitlab-token to store the OpenTofu state. We store them in the same .env file:

::

    echo "" >> .env
    echo "export CR_GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOURTOKEN" >> .env
    echo "export GITLAB_USERNAME=YOURUSERNAME" >> .env
    echo "export GITLAB_STATE_REPOSITORY=YOURSTATEREPO" >> .env

Finally we also need a remote username for ansible:

::

    echo "export ANSIBLE_REMOTE_USER=aecid" >> .env


Activate the configuration
==========================

In order to activate **ALL** configuration at once change into the ansible directory and source the activate file:

::

    cd ansible
    source activate

.. note::

   You need to activate the configuration everytime you want to deploy a testbed or run any scenario!
